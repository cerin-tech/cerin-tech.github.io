        "abstract": "Visual markers, in particular QR codes, have become widely adopted in museums to enable low cost interactive applications. However, visitors often do not engage with them. In this paper we explore the application of visual makers that can be designed to be meaningful and that can be created by visitors themselves. We study both the use of these markers as labels for portraits that link to audio recordings and as a mechanism for visitors to contribute their own reflections to the exhibition by drawing a marker and linking an audio comment. Our findings show visitors appreciated the use of the aesthetic markers and engaged with them at three levels \u2013 physical placement, aesthetic content and digital content. We suggest that these different levels need to be considered in the design of future visiting systems, which make use of such markers, to ensure they are mutually supporting in shaping the experience.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel approach, which involves visitors physically manipulating visual representations of artefacts and scanning with their mobile phone different groups or sequences of items in order to reveal digital information about their relationships. To explore this interaction mechanism we collaborated with a museum to develop an interactive paper map, on which visitors can place tangible representations of artefacts and scan the resulting arrangements. Based on an in-situ study of its use, we reveal that museum visitors engaged in different strategies for exploration of relationships between artefacts in the museum collection (inspection, strategic and experimental configuration), and for social collaboration (sharing the interaction space, adopting interaction roles and sharing a reaction to the \u201creveal\u201d). We discuss how future interactive installations can accommodate these behaviours.",

        "abstract": "Three hundred sixty\u2013degree (360\u00b0) immersive video applications for Head Mounted Display (HMD) devices offer great potential in providing engaging forms of experiential media solutions especially in Cultural Heritage education. Design challenges emerge though by this new kind of immersive media due to the 2D form of resources used for their construction, the lack of depth, the limited interaction and the need to address the sense of presence. In addition, the use of Virtual Reality (VR) headsets often causes nausea, or motion sickness effects imposing further implications in moderate motion design tasks. This paper introduces a methodological categorisation of tasks and techniques for the design of 360\u00b0 immersive video applications. Following the design approach presented, a testbed application has been created as an immersive interactive virtual tour at the historical centre of the city of Rethymno in Crete, Greece, which has undergone user trials. Based on the analysis of the results of this study, a set of design guidelines for the implementation of 360\u00b0 immersive video virtual tours is proposed.",

        "abstract": "Augmented reality is a mature technology that uses the real world as a substrate and extends it by overlaying computer-generated information. It has been applied to several domains. In particular, the technology was proven to be useful for the management and preservation of Cultural Heritage. This study provides an overview of the last decade of the use of augmented reality in cultural heritage through a detailed review of the scientific papers in the field. We analyzed the applications published on Scopus and Clarivate Web of Science databases over a period of 9 years (2012\u20132021). Bibliometric data consisted of 1201 documents, and their analysis was performed using various tools, including ScientoPy, VOS Viewer, and Microsoft Excel. The results revealed eight trending topics of applying augmented reality technology to cultural heritage: 3D reconstruction of cultural artifacts, digital heritage, virtual museums, user experience, education, tourism, intangible cultural heritage, and gamification. Each topic is discussed in detail in the article sections, providing insight into existing applications and research trends for each application field.",

Its principal aim is to transmit to future generations how their ancestors lived, and what their customs and buildings were like, etc. Nowadays, there are different technology systems and research investigations that are focused on CH education that use augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and mixed reality (MR). The aim of this document is to specifically identify if the use of AR improves students\u2019 motivation to learn about topics related to CH. To this end, studies from different databases and specific journals, along with those concerning technology systems, were evaluated, and comparisons were made between them.

        "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) technology has rapidly developed in recent years. This technology is widely used in various fields, including museum exhibitions, where people use it to experience art in a new way. While AR aims to realize the interaction between the virtual world and the real world, museums use AR to develop new digital artwork from artifacts. When text descriptions are no longer attractive to the audience, museums need to add more sound effects to images and video dynamics to develop a sustainable way for the industry\u2019s future. For the continued use of such technology and the better development of the museum industry, this study used a structural equation model to explore the influences on the continuance intention of museum AR technology through experiments and questionnaires. Furthermore, it established a model with six dimensions: interaction quality, information quality, information richness, satisfaction, perceived playfulness, and continuance intention. Moreover, the results of this study can serve as a reference for managers to promote the extensive application of AR technology in museum construction, thereby providing visitors with better experiences and satisfying their needs.",

Two studies are presented: an in-depth evaluation of the Meat the Future exhibition at Oxford University Museum of Natural History and then a comparative study between this exhibition and two other permanent exhibits at the museum. Quantitative and qualitative data provide a nuanced picture of each exhibit from the visitor perspective and showcase the benefits of the MEUX methods of evaluation. Results show how three different exhibits are constructed in different ways, providing different visitor experiences and outcomes. They are directly compared with identify statistical differences, but do not impose a judgment as to whether any exhibit is better than another. With detailed, nuanced and rigorous data capturing visitor experiences of engaging with exhibits, the MEUX evaluation methodology allows for more sophisticated, standardized and efficient evaluation practices within the sector, with results that directly support further development of exhibits and exhibitions.",

Multiple features were identified as desirable for an interactive experience: interdisciplinary design team; in-situ; mixed reality; interactive digital storytelling; avatar; tangible objects; gestures; emotions and groups.

This study therefore aims to identify heritage tourists\u2019 needs and involvement when developing mobile AR heritage applications using a grounded theory approach. Since AR applications are still in their infancy in the tourism industry the grounded theory approach was employed. Fifty in-depth interviews were conducted in Macau\u2019s World Heritage Sites. The interview transcripts were analyzed by the open coding method with the NVivo software, the process of axial coding and the selective coding method. This study generated new requirements for mobile AR heritage applications that reflect the needs of the Asian tourist market, which are different from those of the European tourist market. The characteristic of tourist empowerment and the association between co-creation and tourism were also identified. This study contributes to provide a theoretical framework for designing mobile AR heritage applications and has implications for mobile AR application developers and tourism practitioners.",
